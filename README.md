# AI‑ML‑Training

A collection of hands‑on training projects and tutorials in Python, specifically designed for data analysis, ETL pipelines, and machine learning workflows.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository features Jupyter notebooks demonstrating:
- Data analysis (e.g., employee working hours, electricity usage)
- ETL workflows with logging and pipelines
- Web scraping (e.g., book scraping)
- SQL integration and database operations
- Data cleaning, duplicate masking, and file organization

Ideal for learners and practitioners aiming to build end‑to‑end data/data‑engineering/ML pipelines using real-world data.
